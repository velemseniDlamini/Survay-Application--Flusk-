# üó≥Ô∏è Simple Survey App using Flask

Hey there!  
Thanks for stopping by. This is a small survey web app I built using Flask and SQLite. It allows users to fill out a short survey, and their responses get saved to a local database. It was a great project to learn how web forms and databases work together.


-- What the app does

- Shows a simple survey form in the browser
- Saves the answers to a SQLite database
- Easy to change or add new questions
- Great starting point if you‚Äôre learning Flask

-- What‚Äôs inside the project

Here‚Äôs a quick look at the files:

app.py          -The main Python file that runs the app |
survey.db       -The database where the form answers are saved |

-- Tools and technologies used

- Python
- Flask
- SQLite  
(You can also add HTML/CSS templates later if you want to style the form.)

-- How to run the app locally

Follow these steps to get it up and running:

1. Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/velemseniDlamini/Survay-Application--Flusk-.git
2. cd Survay-Application--Flusk-
3. Install Flask
pip install flask
4. Run the app
python app.py
